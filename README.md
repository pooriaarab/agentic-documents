[Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agentic-documents) · [Source](https://github.com/pooriaarab/agentic-documents) · [Support](https://github.com/pooriaarab/agentic-documents/issues)

Write documents with people and agents in real time.

> Status: early. The document model and the text operations work in Node. The
> package is not on npm yet. The CLI, the MCP server, the HTTP API, and the web
> UI are not built yet.

## Install

```sh
npm install agentic-documents
```

## Quick start

```ts
import { AgenticDoc, Suggestions, Threads } from "agentic-documents";

const agent = { kind: "agent_of_human", name: "scribe" } as const;

const doc = AgenticDoc.fromMarkdown("# Plan\n\nShip on Friday.", agent);
const [plan] = doc.outline();

doc.replace({ text: "Friday" }, "Monday", agent);
doc.insert({ section: plan.id, at: "end" }, "- [ ] Write notes", agent);

console.log(doc.toMarkdown());
console.log(doc.edits()); // each edit keeps the author kind and name

const person = { kind: "human", name: "Ada" } as const;
const suggestions = new Suggestions(doc);
const id = suggestions.add({ text: "Monday" }, "Tuesday", agent);
suggestions.accept(id, person); // the text changes now
new Threads(doc).add({ text: "Tuesday" }, "Is this date firm?", agent);
```

## Features

- A Yjs document that a Tiptap editor can open. It uses the y-prosemirror layout.
- Headings, paragraphs, lists, task lists, tables, code, images, links, and marks.
- Markdown in and out.
- An outline. Each section has an id that stays the same when people edit around it.
- Insert, replace, and delete by section id or by exact text. Append to the end.
- Text anchors that follow their text when other replicas edit.
- Clear errors: `NO_MATCH`, `AMBIGUOUS_MATCH`, `STALE_ANCHOR`, `NO_SECTION`.
- Comment threads on text, with replies and resolve. A thread follows its text.
- Suggested edits (insert, replace, delete). Nothing changes until a person accepts.
  An accepted edit is logged with the accepter as editor and the suggester as origin.
- Every edit, message, and suggestion needs an author. The edit log keeps the kind and the name, so
  agent work stays labeled. The log holds no content.

## Rules for text matching

- A match is exact and case sensitive.
- A match stays inside one block. It cannot cross a paragraph, a cell, or a hard break.
- More than one match is an error, and matches may overlap: `ana` matches twice in `banana`. Pass `occurrence` (1 is the first start) to choose.
- A replacement takes the marks of the first matched character.

## Limits

- No CLI, MCP server, HTTP API, or web UI yet.
- Suggestions work on text, not on whole sections.
- Two replicas that accept the same suggestion at the same time both apply it.
  Accept on one authority, such as the server.
- Export covers Markdown only. HTML, DOCX, and ODT (.odt) exports are planned.
- Text before the first heading has no section id. Use `append` or a text match.
- Markdown with footnotes, or any syntax the model has no place for, is refused with
  `INVALID_INPUT`. Nothing is stored. Reference links and image references are resolved to
  their URL. An unused reference definition is dropped.
- Markdown import drops link titles, table column alignment, and the part of a code fence
  line after the language.
- Markdown output trims whitespace at the edge of a block and skips empty paragraphs. A text
  target that includes a trailing space can match in the document and not in `read` output.
